# prm-gp2gp-ods-downloader

This repository contains the pipeline responsible for fetching ODS codes and names of all active GP practices and ICBs, then saving it to json file.

## Developing

Common development workflows are defined in the `tasks` script.

This project is written in Python 3.9.

### Recommended developer environment

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to easily switch Python versions.
- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies and virtual environments.
- [dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) 
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  to run test suites in the same environment used by the CI/CD server.

#### Installing pyenv
```
brew install pyenv
```

#### Configure your shell's environment for Pyenv

```
For zsh:
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### Install new python and set as default

```
pyenv install 3.9.16
pyenv global 3.9.16
```

#### Installing pipenv and updating pip

In a new shell, run the following:
```
python -m pip install -U pipenv
python -m pip install -U "pip>=22.3.1"
```

#### Build a dev env

In a new shell, in the project directory run:

```
./tasks devenv
```

This will create a python virtual environment containing all required dependencies.

#### Configure SDK

To find out the path of this new virtual environment, run:

```
pipenv --venv
```

Now you can configure the IDE. The steps for IntelliJ are following:
1. Go to `File -> Project Structure -> SDK -> Add SDK -> Python SDK -> Existing environments`
2. Click on three dots, paste the virtual environment path from before, and point to the python binary.
   The path should look like this: `/Users/janeDoe/.local/share/virtualenvs/prm-xxxx-ABCD1234/bin/python3.9` (xxxx is the name of this repo)

### Running the unit tests

`./tasks test`

### Running tests, linting, and type checking

`./tasks validate`

### Running tests, linting, and type checking in a docker container

This will run the validation commands in the same container used by the GoCD pipeline.

`./tasks dojo-validate`

### Auto Formatting

This will format the code and the imports.

`./tasks format`

### Dependency Scanning

`./tasks check-deps`

- If this fails when running outside of Dojo, see [troubleshooting section](### Troubleshooting)


### Configuration

Configuration is achieved via the following environment variables:


| Environment variable  | Description                            | 
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| MAPPING_BUCKET        | Bucket to read asid lookup.            |
| OUTPUT_BUCKET         | Bucket to write organisation metadata. |


### Troubleshooting

#### Checking dependencies fails locally due to pip

If running `./tasks check-deps` fails due to an outdated version of pip, yet works when running it in dojo (i.e. `./tasks dojo-deps`), then the local python environment containing pipenv may need to be updated (using pyenv instead of brew - to better control the pip version).
Ensure you have pyenv installed (use `brew install pyenv`).
Perform the following steps:

1. Run `brew uninstall pipenv`
2. Run the steps listed under [Installing correct version of pip and python](#installing-correct-version-of-pip-and-python)
3. Now running `./tasks check-deps` should pass.

#### Python virtual environments

If you see the below notice when trying to activate the python virtual environment, run `deactivate` before trying again.

> Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1 to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead. You can set PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1 to suppress this warning.
